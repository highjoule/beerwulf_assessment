# beerwulf_assessment

## Dear Breno and Burak

You will find my answers in BEERWULF_TASK-Test.md.

This is the code that will answer the question on the assignment. There is a particular flaw that I could not solve and I would like to tell you how to overcome this if you are running this code:

In a part in this code I load the table files, locally stored, in the SQL server. If at some point the code does not run, please load again the cell where LINEITEM is, and the ones under it. I hope this can let you see the results fully.

I used mysql.connector and Pandas to analyze the information and matplotlib. On an other, I will upload the code in a .zip since all the tables and images are locally stored, you could extract everything locally and run it through Jupyter.

You will find the .md here and in the .zip you will find the Jupyter Notebook, since I mainly used this to make the code.

Additionally, in order to access the Database server I have to put my SQL credentials, just change the password (under pw, some cells below) to yours and should be fine.

Finally, I really enjoyed making this code. Hope to hear back from you and kind regards.

Julio
